## Inventory

### Inventory Overview
Inventory is an interactive utility written in C for maintaining a database of inventory items. It allows you to read an existing data file (`inv.dat`), interact with the inventory through a simple command-line interface, and update the inventory as needed. You can add items, remove items, print the current inventory, and save changes back to the data file.

## Dir-lister

### Dir-lister
Dir-lister is a Bash script that recursively traverses a filesystem subtree, creating a dir.xml file in each directory. The content of the dir.xml files is derived from the directory's structure and an optional README file. The script identifies unlisted directories and files and categorizes them in the XML structure.
